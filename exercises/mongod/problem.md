Hey hey from `learnyoumongo`. First, let's get MongoDB installed.
You can download MongoDB from `https://www.mongodb.org/downloads`.

We will also need to add it to your `$PATH`.

You do not have to create any file with a solution in this exercise.
Just run `learnyoumongo verify` when you are ready with the installation.

-----------------------------------------------------------
## HINTS

To verify that `mongod` is installed, you can try running `mongod --version`.

If you are on Windows, you will need to use `mongod.exe` instead.

It should print out something similar to:

```
db version v3.2.8
git version: ed70e33130c977bda0024c125b56d159573dbaf0
```
